The goal of this exercise was to build an app that tracks expenses and manages a list of trips. The tech stack is MongoDB and Express.js for the middleware. 

I was able to better understand the role of middleware and how to set up endpoints, handle errors, and set up sucessful response bodies. I also gained some experience with using Insomnia to test my endpoints.

Learnings: 

1. Make sure to start up the DB or you get an nice 500
2. Don't try to POST to a GET endpoint
3. JSON is beautiful
